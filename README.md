Advanced Branding Editor
==================
Advanced Branding Editor allows you to define branding options for custom portals, and configure them using a user friendly interface similar to that of the regular Branding Editor.

The regular Branding Editor allows configuration of the out-of-box Service Portal, however the hard-coded fields defined in there for the out-of-box Service Portal are not particularly relevant to custom portals, or other product Service Portal's such as HR or CSM. Advanced Branding Editor offers greater flexibility in this regard - you can define as many variables as you want, custom labeled and configurable for individual portals.

It also offers other features and usability improvements over the out-of-box branding editor, such as:

- "Show me" functionality to show on the preview where the particular element you'll be configuring is.
- "Reset" functionality to reset a variable back to it's default state.
- Image fields
- Portal select dropdown allows filtering

Usage
-------------------
The application comes with the branding groups and branding variables defined for the out-of-box Service Portal, however if you have any other portals then you will need to define groups and variables for these.
